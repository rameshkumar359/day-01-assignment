Q.1)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
ans:
HTTP is hypertext transfer protocal that have been evolved since 1970s.it connects multiple computers initially for communication and data sharing.

its main function is connecting two Ip address from the request side to the server side ip address with tcp 3-way hand shake

differences

                     HTTP 1.1                                                   HTTP 2     
 1)As earlier versions were only supported header version simple webpage        1)it was introduced in 2015 for faster and handle more traffic
but later the task and complexity of webpage increased to overcome 
this HTTP 1.1 was introduced in 1990    

2)it allows multiple request and response per TCP connection.                   2)multiple requset and response with multiple TCP connection

3)it is slower when multiple request placed in one TCP connection.              3)it is faster as multiple request per multiple TCP connection

4)there is no binary conversion of the request                                  4)it converts the request to binary conversion it is secure




Q.2)blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

1)objects are data types used to represent in the format of key:value that contains data in this format.

2)objects and json looks similar but there are difference between them

3)json script are language independant that can be accessed through any language

example-objects
code:
let mobile={color:"red",model:"apple",memory:"123GB"}
console.log(mobile.color)
output:red

we can get key value of an object using the syntax (object.required key name) 

where as json script comes with a string in both key and value

example-json
code:
let mobile={"color":"red","model":"apple","memory":"123GB"}
console.log(mobile.color)
output:red

objects represented with =>{} syntax
